## Context
A few sentences to introduce the topic of the research

## Datasets
The data sets used in the study can be found in the "dataset" folder. 

The first data set contains the results of the dose-response experiments. Each line depict the results for one population of one species at one concentration of one pesticide. 
+ insecticides-mortality.txt
  + *population_ID*: population ID
  + *species*: the Bemisia tabaci species name (either IO or MEAM1)


## R scripts
+ **load_bemisia_data.R**: the script to load the different datasets and the necessary package in the environment
+ **bioassa
